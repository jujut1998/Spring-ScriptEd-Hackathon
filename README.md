### Synopsis

In light of the "STYLE" theme at this 2016 Spring ScriptEd Hackathon, the team
has decided to build a game which gives users the ability to customize various
aspects of the gameplay. These include the gender, skin color, clothing,
fighting style and weapons of their character. After customizing the character,
the user will be able to view their creation in the preview.

### Procedure
The team started off designating different tasks to ensure that the project was
feasible and would be completed in the most efficient way possible. The Project
Manager then worked on setting up the required environments to allow the teams to
begin working. The first set of tasks the team decided to undertake was to create
a wireframe that specifically fitted the needs of the intended project. Next, the designers
to started to design the main page using CSS to make the page presentable. 
The designers also worked in Photoshop to design sprites to facilitate user input.
Meanwhile, the developers worked on the functionality of the page to make it
interactive and user friendly. Both teams then worked together to accept user
inputs and adjust the design of the fighter. While the team worked tirelessly, the
Project Manager worked on setting up everything to ensure that submission would
be as quick and smooth as possible.

### Challenges
Some challenges that we faced included getting the options to function as desired,
completing the animations and also the time restriction that prevented us from being
able to create the game portion of the project.

### Lessons/Skills Developed
The team collectively learned numerous concepts and skills both from each other
and from the volunteers. These include:
JQuery Concepts
JavaScript Concepts
Teamwork Ethics

### Upcoming

In the future, it is our intention to continue working on this project and
potentially get the animations to work and also allow the user to use their
creation to play a mini 2D platform fighting game.
